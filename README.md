# RawInputTouchPadWindows: Multitouch Research Project

This project is a PhD research extension of the original RawInput.Touchpad source code by [emoacht](https://github.com/emoacht/RawInput.Touchpad). It focuses on exploring and developing multitouch capabilities within the Windows environment.

## Key Features

* **Enhanced Multitouch Support:**  Builds upon the RawInput.Touchpad foundation to enable more robust multitouch interactions.
* **Research-Oriented:** Designed for academic exploration and experimentation with multitouch technologies.
* **Windows Compatibility:** Specifically tailored for the Windows operating system.

## Project Motivation: Bridging the Multitouch Gap

A primary challenge in multitouch research on Windows is the disparity in gesture capabilities compared to hardware systems like Mac OSX. While Mac OSX offers a more refined and integrated multitouch experience, Windows often lags behind in terms of native gesture support and responsiveness.

However, this project chooses to focus on Windows development due to its accessibility in educational settings. Windows laptops are more widely available and affordable for students and researchers, making it a practical platform for exploring and advancing multitouch technologies despite its limitations.

By building upon the RawInput.Touchpad library, this research aims to bridge the multitouch gap on Windows, enabling more sophisticated gesture interactions and contributing to the broader understanding of multitouch on a readily accessible platform.


## Important Note: Disable Windows Touchpad Gestures

Before using this project, it's crucial to disable the default Windows touchpad gestures in your system settings. This ensures accurate and unhindered multitouch data collection.
